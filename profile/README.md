## Hi all
This github enterprise organization will be deactivated soon. You should got an invite for the new [Github Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/basf-global) and an information that you need to change the login for your IDE integration to your new github account. 

This account is your userid followed by _basf
If your IDE wants to open a popup, you need to enter manually the URL above instead of the default GitHub URL, because Single Sign on is activated within the new environment.

If you need support, you can raise a question in the KDC Teams or send an email to azuredevops@basf.com
